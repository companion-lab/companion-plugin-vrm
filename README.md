# companion-plugin-vrm

VRM avatar models (with the built-in demo asset), motion and emotion clips, and graphics settings.

One of the official feature plugins for **Companion**, a plugin-based desktop
companion app (Tauri + React). A plugin is a `manifest.json` plus an optional
bundled React frontend and an optional Rust cdylib backend; see the
companion-tauri repository (`app/PLUGINS.md`) for the full plugin format and
host API documentation.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | Plugin metadata: id, ABI version, permissions, entry points |
| `src/` | React frontend source (bundled with esbuild at build time) |
| `backend/` | Rust cdylib backend (asset serving + graphics settings) |
| `assets/model/` | Built-in demo VRM asset (committed) |
| `scripts/` | Asset inspection tools (`inspect-bones.mjs`, `vrma-bake-check.mjs`) |

React is never bundled into the plugin: `react` / `react-dom` are aliased to
the host's copies at build time, so plugin frontends always match the app.

## Building

Install dependencies first (pulls `@companion-lab/plugin` from npm and `companion-plugin-sdk` from crates.io):

```bash
npm install
```


The `companion-cli` CLI ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/companion-cli),
install with `npm install -g companion-cli`) bundles the frontend
(and builds the Rust backend when present) into a zip importable via the app's
**Settings → Plugins → Import plugin…**:

```bash
companion-cli build /path/to/companion-plugin-vrm --backend
```

Install dependencies first if you use a package manager lockfile
(`pnpm install` / `npm install`).
